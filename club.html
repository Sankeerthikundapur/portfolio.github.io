            The main aim and objective was to plan and program system application and to get rid of manual entry and to store it in a file so that 
       easily available. We have to apply the best software engineering practice for system application. We developed “club management system” 
       where the software Dev C++ is used and basic operations like insertion, deletion, display, modify and search can be performed. The club 
       management system facilitates the administrator to manage member details of the club and event details conducted in the club. It is the 
       computerized system of storing member and event details. The club management is software for the purpose of inserting a member or 
       hosting an event any time and from anywhere. </p> </div>
